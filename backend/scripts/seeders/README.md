## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Seed all medical record data
npm run seed:medical

# Or seed individually
npm run seed:icd10     # ICD-10 codes only
npm run seed:cpoe      # CPOE orders only
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# From backend directory
node scripts/seeders/masterMedicalRecordsSeeder.js

# Individual seeders
node -e "import('./scripts/seeders/icd10Seeder.js').then(m => m.seedICD10Codes())"
node -e "import('./scripts/seeders/cpoeSeeder.js').then(m => m.seedCPOEOrders())"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Medical Record Functionality
```bash
# Run comprehensive functionality tests
npm run test:medical

# Or manually
node scripts/testMedicalRecordFunctionality.js
```

### Test Coverage Includes:
- **ICD-10 Management**: Search, statistics, role-based access
- **CPOE Orders**: Creation, management, safety checks
- **Medical Records**: CRUD operations, clinical assessments
- **Role-Based Access**: Doctor/Nurse/Admin/Patient permissions
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Drug interactions, allergy alerts

- **3 comprehensive medical records** with clinical data
- **9+ CPOE orders** across all order types
- **Role-based access** fully functional
- **Clinical workflows** ready for testing

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Database connection issues
Error: MongoError: Authentication failed
Solution: Check DB_URI and credentials

# Missing dependencies
Error: Cannot find module
Solution: npm install in backend directory

# Role-based access denied
Error: Insufficient permissions
Solution: Verify user roles in database
```

### Validation
```bash
# Check seeded data
mongo hospital_db
> db.icd10codes.count()     # Should return 20+
> db.enhancedmedicalrecords.count()  # Should return 3
> db.cpoes.count()          # Should return 9+
```
